# The CDIAC at AppState Dashboard

Author: M. W. Hefner

This dashboard displays both the traditional reference approach CDIAC dataset and the new, consumption-based dataset.  The dashboard allows displays of an interactive choropleth map, a browsing table, and time series.  It also contains pages for information about CDIAC at AppState,

This dashboard application is also intended to be an example of standard practice documentation and design for web application based research data infrastructure deployed in support of RIEEE.

This application is built using Dash, a Python framework for building interactive web applications. It utilizes the Plotly library for creating data visualizations.
