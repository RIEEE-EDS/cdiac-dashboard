Attributes
----------
layout : dash.html.Div
    The main HTML container that holds all control elements, including navigation dropdowns,
    user interaction controls like theme toggles, and various data selection options. Also includes
    a descriptive paragraph with a link to more information about CDIAC at Appalachian State University.

component_id : str
    The identifier for the controls container, used for targeting with callbacks and styling.

components.control_panel.controls.* : Modules that define individual controls like dropdowns for
fuel type, source selection, and navigation within the dashboard.

Notes
-----
This module plays a critical role in user interaction, facilitating the selection and filtering
of data visualized in the dashboard. It ensures that all controls are accessible and functional,
allowing for dynamic updates to the data displays based on user input.

The layout of the controls container is structured to provide a user-friendly interface with all
necessary controls neatly organized. Here's how the layout is defined:

        id=component_id,
        children=[
