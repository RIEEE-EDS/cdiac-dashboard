/* DESCRIPTION */

/* Styles are typically left in the python source. */
/* This is to keep things a unilingual as possible */
/* and for ease of access across development modes.*/

/* Some things (like hover behavior) HAVE to be in */
/* an actual CSS file, or would be much easier in */
/* such a file.  Those things are handled here. */

/* Notes */

/* This comes from the Research Institute for Environment, */
/* Energy, and Economics' DataDash application template.*/
